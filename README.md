## Design(N:B):
1. I have changed login button coz i thought a gradient login button will suit
2. I have created a reaction list view as it is not in given Figma 
3. I have named the community appbar as per figma as it is not mentioned fetch community  api
4.Due to extreme workload in my office i could not manage all the design issues and some funtionality as my office has no holiday in saturday. I hope that would be conidered too.
5. I Have added A splash screen and shimmer loader for the app.
6. I will work on the issues after my office time if it is permitted.
